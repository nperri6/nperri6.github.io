	      The group_by enumerator function has tons of functionability in Ruby. The ruby docs describes it as an enumerator that takes a collection and some condition about that collection, and returns a hash that gives keys of each possible outcome, and a value containing an array with each item in the collection that resulted in the key.  While this might seem like a complex explaination, it actually rather straight forward and powerful. Lets look at an example.

	    <p>
	      Lets say you have you wanted to look at the states of the United States and determine which ones had had over 4 million poeple living in them. You could do something like this:
	    </p>
	    <pre><code>
	     	([hash of states with population]).group_by {|state, population| population > 4000000}
	    </code></pre>
	    <p>
	        This type of problem should give a hash with two keys, true and false, with the values being an array containing the hashes that were the states with over or under 4million poeple.
