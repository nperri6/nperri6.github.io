	  <h4> What is the deal with classes? </h4>
	    <p>
	      Up to this point in our phase 0 curriculum, we haven't done a whole ton with classes, but they are starting to be integrated more and more.  Classes really open the door for a lot of the power that ruby has to offer.  Once we start exploring classes we will be able to store data that is unique to different instances.  You want to create a video game, or a bank simulator, or anything where you track some kind of stats? You need to start using your classes!
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The great thing that classes offer is the ability to create more than 1 instance of the same class.  For instance, if I were creating a video game where you had a character that gained levels, picked up items, had health and attacked, I could create a class that defined all characters, and then create instances of that class that represented each character.  Lets look at how we might do that below.
	    </p>
	    <pre><code> 
	    class Character
	    	attr_reader :name
	    	attr_accessor :health, :attack, :defense, :weapons, :armor

	    	def initialize(name)
	    		@name = name
	    		@health = 100
	    		@attack = 25
	    		@defense = 25
	    		@weapons = {}
	    		@armor = {}
	    	end
	    end	
	    </code></pre>

	    <p>
	    So far what we have created is the start of our class for our character.  If you look whenevever you create a new character you are going to be sending it a name.  So you could do    
	    </p>
	    <pre><code> nick = Character.new("Nick") </code></pre>
	    <p> 
	    	Now we have a new instance of character which will represent the character Nick! Now when this Nick character is created he is created with some base stats.  You see these in the initialize method.  This method is used to set some default variables right away.  For him to be a character he has to have health, attack, defense, weapons, and armor (in this basic game).  
	    </p>
	    <p> If you will notice I also set some attr_reader and attr-accessors.  This characters name will never change, but his stats definitely could! So that is why name is a reader but the rest are accessors (because we want to be able to read and change them)</p>

	    <p> Now we can get creative with what we want to do! We can build methods that can change our characters stats. Lets do a couple just for fun! </p>

	     <pre><code> 
	    class Character
	    	attr_reader :name
	    	attr_accessor :health, :attack, :defense, :weapons, :armor

	    	def initialize(name)
	    		@name = name
	    		@health = 100
	    		@attack = 25
	    		@defense = 25
	    		@weapons = {}
	    		@armor = {}
	    	end

	    	def eat
	    		@health += 10
	    	end

	    	def fight
	    		@health -= rand(1..50)
	    		if @health <= 0
	    			death
	    		else
	    			# could generate some loot here for you to win!
	    			# you could have an hash of available loot stored
	    			#and when you win a fight you could .sample that loot
	    			#and add it to your weapons or armor hash
	    		end
	    	end

	    	def death
	    		p "Sorry your character has died, please create a new character"
	    	end
	    end	
		 </code></pre>

		 <p> Here I added just a few methods to get the idea of what we could do with this class.  Now we have methods for our character's health to increase or decrease.  If he eats his health will go up by 10. If he fights his health will go down by some random amount from 1-50.  If his health reaches 0 then it will call the death method which will tell you that you died!  (OH NO!!!!).  For this basic example the class simply prompts you to create a new character, but you could have it do any number of things! I also added a space where you could see how you add in something to generate some loot. Pretty neat huh! </p>

		 <p> The great thing is since you used a class to create this backbone of code you can create more than 1 character at a time and have them interact with each other! </p>
