	      Often times we are lead to believe that we can be anything that we want to be.  While this is a possibly true statement, real life doesn't reflect that statement.  If what you ended up doing in your life was based on random chance (your random interest), then in any given career field you should see a the proportions of each race and gender represent their population proportion in greater society.  So ~50% should be female, 13% black, etc.  However, this ideal scenario is far from the truth. Many fields, especially tech fields, are run predominately by white males.  There are many reasons for this, but one large factor is stereotype threat. 
	    </p>
	    <h4> What is stereotype threat anyways? </h4>
	    <p>
	      Stereotype threat occurs whenever you are in a position where you could potentially feel threatened by some trait that you identify with.  For instance, there is a dated stereotype that woman are worse than men in math. If you were a woman and you were doing math, you would be either consciously or subconsciously aware of this stereotype, and it definitely impact your desire to pursue math. It doesn't mean that you actually are worse at math, it simply means that the perception that women are worse than math might invoke you to be threatened.  If you struggle with a math problem you might feel that you are a representative for a larger group identity, and you will perform worse.  There have been a number of studies that have been conducted in support of this idea.  Simply by prefacing a test with a statement that would make the person feel some type of stereotype threat, they were able to make them perform worse.  On the other end, if they justified a stereotype threat a person might have prior to the test, they performed better.   
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I feel that we have all felt stereotype threat at some point in our lives.  I have had the privilege of being a white male in America, so experiences with stereotype threat have not been as drastic as many others would be.  I have experienced stereotype threat when I was abroad teaching in Thailand.  There are many stereotypes about Americans abroad that you can play into or have to deal with. </p>
	      <p>  Luckily for me, these threats haven't had a lasting impact on me( because they have not been very intrusive).  However, I have lived in areas where stereotype threat definitely molds entire communities. I have witnessed stereotype threats influence youth drastically.  As you grow up your perception of the world develops based on your experiences.  As kids grow up hearing things about their identity, they often internalize those statements as true.  It is hard as a kid to argue against what society is telling you to be true.  
	    </p>
	    <p> Stereotype threat is something that we should be continually aware of on a daily basis.  It is important to take into consideration the identities of others, and ensure that we aren't creating an environment that threatens their identities.  Not only will this make the environment a better place for all, but the research suggests that it would actually cause people to perform better in tough situations! </p>
