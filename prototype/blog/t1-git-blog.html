         There are many benefits to using version control. Have you ever had a time in your life when you wish you could rewind the clock and relive a decision over again? Maybe you wouldn't have eaten that leftover burger that had been sitting in the fridge for some time but was "probably still good to eat".  Version control allows you to go back and review those type of decisions!
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is g reat for helping you track changes! Thanks to version control you can see exactly what you changed and when.  If you want to go back in time you simply pull back up that previous version and get to work.  You can see what you did every time you commit a change becuase you leave a message for yourself.  When you commit you do a simple git commit -m " this is the message". 
      </p>

        Github is great place for storing your code.  Github allows you to store your git repos all under a username.  You can check out what projects other poeple are working on and fork it if its something you would like to contribute to.  Other individuals can help you with your project as well!  Even if you are working by yourself, you can keep your projects on github so that you can access them from another computer!
