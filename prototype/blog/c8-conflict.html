			<h5> Sept 20, 2015 </h5>

	      We all have experienced times when we have had a conflict.  These times can be very trying, and understanding how to deal with them can really make a huge difference in your productive and success.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      One conflict that I have had was when I was a teacher in Thailand.  There were serious disagreements between the foreign teachers on the best ways to operate your classroom.  At our school you only were responsible for teaching for 3-4 hours a day, and the rest of the hours were taught by Thai teachers.  The conflict arose from what you should be doing in the hours that you aren't directly teaching.  Some teachers felt that it was their free time and they could go home if they pleased. Others felt obligated to never leave their classroom and make sure that they always were at their desk in case they were needed.  I fell in the middle where I felt it was important to stay on campus and be working during work hours, but due to a lack of internet in the classroom, found it impossible to actually work at times in the classroom so trips to the school library were essential.  
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        The main part of the problem was that as foreign teachers we were often all grouped together. If one person was going home each day that reflected on all of us as a unit. Throughout the conflict I had a mix of emotions ranging from anger to resignment, but I did my best to stay positive and keep working hard.  I knew that I couldn't control the behavior of my coworkers, nor was I in an authoritative position to do so.  I had to take it in stride that each person had their own beliefs as to the best actions in this situation and I had to respect everyone opinion.  
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    After much deliberation with our coordinators we decided that it was important for teachers to remain on campus and in their classrooms as much as possible, with the exception of needing to use the internet or get work done in the school.  If I could go back I would have tried to bring the issue up earlier in the year before people started to get passionate about how they wanted to handle their non teaching hours.  
	    </p>
	    <p> I did learn a lot from this experience. It is important to get at the root of issues before they grow into big ones.  Had we laid ground rules out at the beginning of the year then people would have all been on the same page, and there would have been an answer to our problem of what to do during that time.  For problems of this nature, if possible it is definitely advantageous to solve conflicts prior to people becoming too emotionally invested in the outcome.
