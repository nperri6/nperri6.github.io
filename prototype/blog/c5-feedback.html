			<h4> The World of Pairing </h4>
	    <p>
	      Each week during Phase 0 of DBC we are asked to pair with at least 2 different people to work on the week's curriculum. What generally happens is that you meet your pair over the Google hangouts video, where you can screen share your work.  I have really enjoyed my pairing sessions so far.  Especially since we are mostly working alone at this stage, it is nice to get online and talk to other people that are passionate about learning the same thing that you are. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Solving problems with a pair is definitely different than going alone.  When I am alone, I like to throw out some rudimentary psuedocode, and hit the editor to quickly test out some of my method ideas. When pairing, you have to take in the coding style of each member of the pair.  Some people like to discuss a ton of theory up front, while others might want to simply jump into code right away.  Navigating these coding styles takes patience, but I have found it very rewarding.  Each time I pair I pick up on a new best practice or trait that I would like to incorporate into my coding style.  From simple things like command line shortcuts, to new ruby methods to try to implement, pairing has tons of rewards.   As long as you have the correct mindset to work together, pairing is great!
	    </p>
	    <h4> Feedback </h4>
	    <p>
	        Part of the pairing process is to leave feedback for your pair that can help them improve their practice.  I have found my own feedback rather instructive in how I approach pairing sessions.  I have gotten some great feedback on small ways that I can improve my pairing approach, and have found the feedback a nice reminder of what I have been doing correct as well.   
	    </p>
	    <p> Writing feedback on the other hand can be sometimes challenging.  You want to write feedback that is kind, specific and actionable, but it is sometimes hard to pick something to improve upon, especially if the pair worked out well together!   I find myself saying a lot of the same stuff each time, because I have been really enjoying my sessions.  However, I do try to think of something that I can include that could help my pair improve going forward. </p>

	    <p> Overall I have greatly enjoyed my pairing and look forward to many more pairs to come in the future! </p>
