			<h5> Sept 23, 2015 </h5>

	      There are times when all of us will need to ask a question.  This is especially true for programmers.  There are tons of resources and communities of people out there that want to help you, but you have to be able to convey your question properly.  Asking a question that will get a favorable response takes a little planning and awareness of the community or person that you are asking.  
	    	</p>
	    	<p>
	      There are a number of rules that make up a good question, and these rules can vary depending on who you ask.  As a general rule of thumb, your questions should be specific, informative, able to replicated, and courteous.  You should give very specific information into what is troubling you and avoid statements like "someone help me learn ruby!".  People are much more willing to help you solve a problem than explain an entire language to you!
	    	</p>
	    <p>
	      Reflecting on my own question asking, I am not always as specific as I should be.  I am an avid Quora and Stack Overflow reader so I have some experience with the proper way to structure questions, but sometimes it is hard to figure out the best way to ask a question.  When you are dealing with code in particular, it can often be a challenge to determine what information is pertinent to include in the question.  
	   	</p>

	    <p> For instance, sometimes you have a question about a class you are working on that interacts with 4 other classes. In this case, how do you explain that relationship in a short question description? Do you link those other classes as well in your explanation of the problem?  
	    </p>
	    <p> It can be difficult to navigate these types of problems, but what I have found is to just start asking questions and adjust your question answer based on the feedback you receive from people trying to help you.  Often on Stack Overflow you will have people answer your question right away. On the other hand if you ask a bad question people will let you know right away.  Take the criticism constructively and use that to help formulate your questions in the future.  You often won't ask the perfect question the first time, but that is OK! If you take the feedback and use it you will be writing great questions in no time.  Also a good idea is to look at how other people ask questions and model your questioning based on their best practices.
