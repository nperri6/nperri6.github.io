			<h4> The World of Pairing </h4>
	    <p>
	      If you follow the news, the frequency of security breaches seems to be continually on the rise.  From hacking major resale chains, all the way up to hacking government data base infrastructure, no one appears safe from those that want to use their data.  As our society becomes ever more tech dependent, the issue of online security is growing. It will take innovative solutions to ensure that our technology continues to be safe to use.   
	    </p>
	    <h4> Hackers: are they good or bad? </h4>
	    <p>
	      The word hacker often carries with it a negative connotation, but that isn't necessarily true.  While those who hack and steal your data for negative uses would be considered hackers, there is a much larger group of hackers that are working to combat abuse of software.  In essence, there are tons of individuals around the world trying to hack into software to determine the vulnerabilities so that we can patch those vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.  
	    </p>
	    <p>
	       Hacking conventions have becoming more and more prevalent. At these conventions, hackers come together and share what they have learned about different vulnerabilities, so that we can be better informed in preventing them in the future. In addition to conventions, most companies have bounties in place for individuals that report bugs to their company.  This gives individuals incentive to report vulnerabilities without drawing unnecessary attention to them until they are fixed.  
	    </p>
	    <h4> How safe are you? </h4>
	    <p> Online security is a topic much broader than the scope covered in this blog post. However, there are a simple few things you can do to reduce the chances that you fall victim to security threats.  
	      <ul> 
	      	<li> Use unique, strong passwords (and change them frequently) </li>
	      	<li> Update your applications and web browsers! - Usually updates fix security vulnerabilities! </li>
	      	<li> When buying online, be careful about which sites you give your credit card information to.  If paypal is an option, it isn't a bad idea (especially if its an obscure site)</li>
	      	<li> Always change anything that has a default username or password! These are the type of devices that hackers seek out (because they know most people don't change that information)</li>
	      	<li> Be wise about what you download- if the site is filled with adds everywhere, it is probably not a good site to download from </li>
	      	<li> Use antivirus software. </li>
      	   </ul>
      	  </p>
