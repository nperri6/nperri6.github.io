			<h3> Bio </h3>

			<p id="port-description"> Hi, my name is Nick.  I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2012 with a BS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  I have always had a love for anything science, technology, or education. </p>

			<p> After college I joined Teach For America where I taught high school earth science, anatomy, and robotics, while concurrently getting my Master's in the Art of Teaching (MAT) from Oakland University. After two years, I decided to further my perspectives on education and culture by spending 9 months teaching in Thailand.</p>

			<p> As much as I have enjoyed my journey teaching science and technology, in early 2015 I decided it was time for me to further explore the technology that I had enjoyed teaching so much at a basic level.  I started to teach myself computer programming, loved it, and saught out more formal training to accelerate my learning.  This landed me at Dev Bootcamp where I am currently learning the world of computer programming! </p>
