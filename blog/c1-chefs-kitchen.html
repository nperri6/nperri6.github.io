  <h2>Shereef's take on DBC</h2>
  <h4>August 2nd, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Having just finished watching Shereef's Fireside Chat I have some new  perspective on what DBC is all about.  Much of what was on the video I had already figured out through independent research on the internet about DBC. However, it was nice to hear the vision and mission of DBC through Shereef's own words.

        Shereef stresses the idea of taking control of your education while you are at DBC.  DBC is not your traditional school.  DBC is an accelerated learning platform where you really only get out as much as you put in.  Simply showing up is not going to get you ready to be a web developer. You must be willing to commit yourself and focus your attention 100% to actually learning how to be web developer.  
    </p>
    <p>
        This idea of owning your education resonates with me.  I am excited to really dive deep into the world of web development.  I look forward to surrounding myself with indivudals that are also 100% commited to developing their skills.  I find accelerated learning platforms well worth the investment.
