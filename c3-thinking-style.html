  			<h2>Being an Abstract Sequential Thinker</h2>

	      There are many different ways to classify the ways we act and think.  One interesting way to look at how you think is with the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html"> Gregorc Thinking Style </a> After taking this test myself, I learned that I am mostly an abstract sequential thinker.

	    <h4> Abstract Sequential Thinking </h4>
	    <p>Abstract sequential thinking is mostly defined by someone who:
	      <ul>
	      	<li> likes to be heard </li>
	      	<li> analyzes situations before making decisions </li>
	      	<li> applys logic in solving or finding solutions to problems </li>
	      	<li> likes to have access to experts and stimulating environments, but is also able to work alone </li>
	      	</ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>AS thinkers generally struggle with: 
	        <ul>
	        	<li> Being forced to work with those of different views </li>
	        	<li> having too little time to work through a subject </li>
	        	<li> have to deal with lots of specific rules, repeating tasks, expressing their eomotions, or engaging with sentimental thinking </li>
        	</ul>

	    </p>

	    <p> I definitely agree that a lot of these traits have summed up my experiences so far in DBC.  I enjoy talking with other people and helping them solve their answers.  I have had a fun time working through the ruby problems and addressing problems that poeple are having. </p>

	    <p> I do feel that I haven't had enough time to work through a lot of the HTML and CSS stuff so I would like to revisit that stuff in the future.  Luckily, I have done a bit of Ruby in the past so I do feel comfortable with the amount of time that we have been given to learn it.  I do find myself sometimes struggling to fill out the reflections, or even blog, as it isn't necessarily what I find most enjoyable about programming. (though I definitely see the value in it!) </p>
