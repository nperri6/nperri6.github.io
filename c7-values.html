	  	<h3> What Values Are Most Important to Me? </h3>
	    <p>
	      There are a number of values that I find important.  One of the most important values for me is openness.  I find openness to be essential to growth and living a fulfilling life.  I use the term openness very broadly and associate it with academics, politics, and social situations.  If we are not open to learning and hearing others, then we are not growing, and possibly offending those we are engaging with (consciously or subconsciously). 
	    </p>
	    <h3> Giving Advice </h3>
	    <p>
	      The last topic that someone asked advice from me on was interviewing.  The topic actually played a lot into my idea of openness.  I gave the advice of putting yourself in the shoes of the interviewer/company.  What do you think they want in a candidate? How do you think they are going to score the interview? What types of things could you possibly do or say that would impress them? What types of things could you do or say that would leave a bad taste in their mouthes? Interviews aren't necessarily all about you. You have to be open to what the interviewer is looking for and figure out how your skill set aligns well with the company. BUT you also have to be open to the idea that the company might not be right for you. You should be interviewing them as much as they are you, because after all - you will have to work there if you get the job!

	    <h3> My Values and Stereotype Threat </h3>
	    <p>
	        There have definitely been times when my value of openness has put me in a position of stereotype threat.  One of the things that gets me flustered is when I am in a group of individuals that are close minded.  This could be socially, politically, or academically close minded.  It can be very hard to interact with people that are ingrained in their views so much that they are unwilling to budge in the face of surmounting evidence that suggests they are wrong. Sometimes when I meet people like this I do feel threatened and feel that it might not be worth providing my thoughts and ideas because they will be falling on deaf ears.  However, I have been working on working through this.  I have been making an effort to keep my value of openness strong and be open to their ideas, and try to have a conversation about topics we disagree on.  While we definitely won't agree on everything, engaging allows me to live up to my openness value.

	    <h3> Pick-me-ups at DBC </h3>
	    <p> If for some reason I get down at DBC I will push forward with the idea of openness.  I will self-reflect on what I have been doing well and what I could improve upon, and be open to the idea of making changes to the way I operate to ensure I get the most out of the experience. </p>
